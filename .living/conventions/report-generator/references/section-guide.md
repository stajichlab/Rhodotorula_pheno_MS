## Abstract

The abstract is the most-read part of any report. Many readers will read only this.

**Structure**: Lead with the question, then the approach (one sentence), then the key finding. End with the implication or next step.

**Audience**: A general technical person who is not in your field. They should understand what you did and why it matters without needing domain expertise.

**Lead with the story, not the apparatus.** The abstract is a place to be readable, not a place to enumerate. Open with the scientific question and why it matters in plain language; make a non-specialist *want* to read on. The rules below (numbers, acronyms, citations) are guardrails against overload — they are not an instruction to write tersely or mechanically. A correct abstract that reads like a CSV summary has missed the point.

**Rules**:
- No undefined acronyms — define on first use or avoid entirely
- No figure or table references
- No citations
- State the actual finding, not "results are discussed" — be concrete
- 150-250 words, 1-2 paragraphs

**Example pattern**:
```
[Scientific question in plain language]. To address this, we [approach in one sentence].
We found that [key finding with the most important number]. [Second finding if needed].
These results [implication — what does this mean for the field/project/next step].
```

**Common mistakes**:
- Starting with the method ("We used DESeq2 to...") instead of the question
- Being vague about the finding ("Several genes were differentially expressed") instead of specific ("247 genes were upregulated, enriched for inflammatory pathways")
- Including too much methodological detail

---

## Problem Statement

This section exists so that someone outside the immediate project can understand what you're doing and why. It replaces the traditional "Introduction" with something more focused and accessible — but it is still an *introduction*, and it is where the report earns a reader's attention. Default to a genuine, readable, higher-level framing: motivate the problem, sketch the scientific context, and tell the reader why this question is worth their time before you descend into specifics. This is the section where the in-house style consistently reads better than a bare methods setup; match that warmth here. Readability is the default, not a reward for finishing the rigor.

**What to include**:
- The question, in plain English
- Why the answer matters (what decision does it inform? what understanding does it advance?)
- What a good answer would look like (what would you need to see to be convinced?)
- Every concept a non-specialist needs to follow the rest of the report

**How to write it**:
- Start broad, narrow to specific
- Define terms as you introduce them, not in a separate glossary
- Use concrete examples over abstract descriptions
- If you find yourself writing "it is well known that..." — either cite it or cut it

**Test**: Give this section to someone outside your immediate team. If they can't explain back to you what the report is about, rewrite it.

## Methods: Definitions

This subsection is unusual and extremely valuable. Most reports scatter definitions throughout the text or assume the reader knows them. This creates a single reference point.

**What to define**:
- Every mathematical symbol used anywhere in the report (what it represents, units if applicable, range of valid values)
- Every technical term that a smart non-specialist might not know
- Every domain-specific concept (even common ones — "differential expression," "clustering," "normalization")
- Any term used non-standardly — call it out explicitly ("In this report, 'significant' means padj < 0.05 by Benjamini-Hochberg correction, not a subjective judgment of importance")

**Format**:
```latex
\subsection{Definitions}

\textbf{Log2 fold change} ($\log_2 \text{FC}$): The base-2 logarithm of the ratio
of expression between two conditions. A value of 1 means the gene is twice as
expressed in the treatment; $-1$ means half as expressed. Range: $(-\infty, +\infty)$.

\textbf{Adjusted p-value} ($p_{\text{adj}}$): A p-value corrected for multiple
hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Controls the false
discovery rate (FDR) — the expected proportion of false positives among rejected
hypotheses. Range: $[0, 1]$.
```

**Grouping**: Put related definitions together (all statistical terms, then all biological terms, then all computational terms). Use the order they'll appear in the report.

---

## Methods: Overview

2-3 sentences that a non-specialist can follow. This is the "elevator pitch" for the methodology.

**Example**:
```
We compared gene expression between treatment and control conditions across 12
patient samples using standard RNA-seq differential expression analysis. Genes
with statistically significant changes were tested for enrichment in known
biological pathways to identify the functional impact of treatment.
```

No tool names, no parameters, no version numbers. Those go in Technical Detail.

---

## Methods: Technical Detail

The reproducibility section. Someone should be able to re-run your analysis from this.

**Required elements**:
- **Datasets**: Name, source, size (n samples, n features), any preprocessing applied before your analysis began
- **Software**: Tool name, version, and citation for every tool used (including R/Python version)
- **Parameters**: Every non-default parameter with a rationale. Default parameters should also be stated (defaults change between versions)
- **Statistical methods**: Test name, assumptions checked, correction method, significance threshold
- **Computational environment**: OS, hardware if relevant (GPU for deep learning), runtime for expensive steps

**Rationale for parameters**: Don't just list them — explain why. "We used `min_genes=500` to filter low-quality cells (below the inflection point in the genes-per-cell distribution, Figure S1)" is much more useful than "We used `min_genes=500`."

If parameters were chosen via sensitivity analysis, reference the appendix figure.

---

## Results

Each result should be a self-contained unit that a reader can understand independently. The skill supports two styles for Results sections; the Phase-0 planning brief picks one and `manifest.policies.results_structure` carries the choice forward.

### Narrative (DEFAULT)

Each result is prose. The subsection title states the finding (it is checked by Phase 5 — see "Subsection title quality" below). The body covers the question, the competing-hypothesis discrimination, the findings, and the interpretation as a single readable flow rather than four bolded subheadings.

A narrative result still owes the reader the same four things — question, discrimination, findings, interpretation — but in prose. The advantage is that the section reads more like a final paper or polished writeup; the disadvantage is that a skim reader can't land on "what was the question?" by visual search alone.

Example shape (one paragraph or two, depending on density):

> *"We asked whether [Q]. Under the alternative we'd expect [A]; under the null we'd expect [N]. The headline panel showed [finding with sourced numbers]. This is consistent with [interpretation]."*

### Structured (opt-in)

Each result carries explicit paragraph headers in the LaTeX:

```latex
\paragraph{Question.} What specific question is this result addressing?
\paragraph{Discrimination.} What would you expect under competing hypotheses?
\paragraph{Findings.} The actual data — figures, tables, statistics.
\paragraph{Interpretation.} What does this mean for the question?
```

Use the structured style when results pile up (≥ 5 sub-results in a long Results section), when readers want to skim to a specific question, or when the analysis is methodologically complex enough that the discrimination step is genuinely the load-bearing one.

The structured style pays a visual-heaviness tax — every result is four paragraph breaks — that the narrative style does not. The skill defaults to narrative because most reports benefit more from readability than from skim-grid-ability; structured is a deliberate choice, not a fallback.

### Subsection title quality (both styles)

Regardless of which style is chosen, every Results subsection title should state a finding. "Evidence-first cell calling" is a topic; "Evidence-first calling trades recall for precision in a transparent way" is a finding. The Phase 5 sub-agent flags topic-only titles in Results (Methods, Provenance, and References titles are allowed to be topics).

**Figures and tables**:
- **Use the figures the analysis produced.** Before writing a result, check `outputs/figures/` (and any figure directory the analysis uses) for a plot that shows it, and integrate that figure with `\includegraphics`, a self-contained caption, and a `\ref{}`. A well-chosen figure communicates a result faster than a paragraph; integrating figures well is the in-house style's clearest advantage, and this skill should match it rather than defaulting to a figure-free archive. Register every figure you include in `manifest.figures[*]` with its `sha256` (Phase 1) so Phase 6 can verify freshness. Shipping zero figures should be a deliberate choice for a genuinely figure-free analysis, not the default outcome.
- Every figure and table must be referenced in the text — if it's not discussed, it shouldn't be there
- Captions must be self-contained: a reader should understand the figure from the caption alone without reading the surrounding text
- Caption pattern: "[What the figure shows]. [How to read it]. [Key takeaway]."
- Example: "Volcano plot of differential expression between treatment and control. Each point is a gene; x-axis shows log2 fold change, y-axis shows -log10 adjusted p-value. Red points exceed both significance thresholds (padj < 0.05, |log2FC| > 1). The 247 significant genes are predominantly upregulated, consistent with treatment-induced activation."

---

## Conclusions

**Rules**:
- Map every conclusion back to the problem statement. If the problem statement asked three questions, the conclusions should address all three (even if the answer is "we couldn't determine this")
- State caveats explicitly: "This analysis does not address...", "A limitation is...", "This result is contingent on..."
- Distinguish what the data shows (direct evidence) from what it suggests (interpretation, extrapolation)
- Do not introduce new results here
- Do not overstate: "is consistent with" not "proves"; "suggests" not "demonstrates" (unless the evidence is truly definitive)

**Pattern**:
```
Our analysis addressed [question from problem statement]. We found [key result],
which [interpretation]. This is subject to [caveat/limitation]. Specifically,
[what the analysis does not address].

[If applicable: This result, combined with [prior knowledge], suggests [broader
implication]. However, [what would need to be true for this interpretation to hold].
```

**CRITICAL — Write order**:
- Conclusions must be the LAST section written, after Results are complete and verified.
- Read back what you wrote in Results before writing this section. Base every conclusion on specific findings you already reported — cite the figure or statistic.
- If results contradict the original hypothesis, say so directly. A null or negative result is a valid conclusion.
- Never write conclusions as a template to be "filled in later" — by the time you write this section, all the data is available. Use it.

## Provenance

This section is auto-populated — the agent should fill it programmatically, not write it by hand.

**What to include**:
```latex
\section{Provenance}

\begin{description}
\item[Analysis directory] \texttt{analysis/[name]/}

```

Pull this information from:
- `git log --oneline` for the analysis directory
- `ls` of the scripts directory

## Appendix

The appendix is for supplementary material that supports the main narrative but would interrupt it if placed inline. The most common use is sensitivity analysis figures from the robust-analysis convention pack.

**What belongs here**:
- Parameter sweep figures showing how results change across threshold values
- Method comparison figures (e.g., UMAP vs PCA vs t-SNE)
- Subsample stability results
- Alternative visualizations of the same data
- Extended tables too large for the main text
- QC figures (if not already in the results)

**How to structure it**:
```latex
\appendix

\section{Parameter Sensitivity}

\subsection{P-value Threshold Sensitivity}
Figure~\ref{fig:pvalue_sensitivity} shows how the number of significant genes
varies across adjusted p-value thresholds from 0.01 to 0.10. The chosen
threshold of 0.05 falls in a stable region of the curve.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../outputs/figures/supplementary/threshold_sensitivity_pvalue.png}
    \caption{Number of significant genes as a function of the adjusted p-value
    threshold. The dashed red line indicates the chosen threshold (0.05).
    The result is stable across the range 0.03--0.07.}
    \label{fig:pvalue_sensitivity}
\end{figure}
```

Each appendix figure should have:
- A clear title indicating what was varied
- A caption explaining what the figure shows and what conclusion to draw
- A reference from the main text methods section ("Parameter sensitivity is shown in Appendix A")

---

## Cross-cutting craft

The rules below apply across sections. They are checked automatically by the Phase 4 (plain-English lint), Phase 5 (framing critique), and Phase 6 (blind numerical re-verify) sub-agents in the report-generator flow.

### Acronym discipline

The abstract, section titles, and figure captions never carry an undefined acronym, regardless of audience. A "BCLRT" in the abstract is a finding — even when the term is defined in Methods later.

The per-page budget and per-section regloss strictness scale with the **Phase-0 audience tier**, which Phase 1 records in `manifest.policies.acronym_budget_per_page` and `manifest.policies.acronym_strictness`:

| Tier | Acronym budget / page | First-use-per-section gloss | Example audiences |
|---|---:|---|---|
| **A** (lay / out-of-field) | 2 | every term, every section | grant reviewers, lay collaborators, journalists |
| **B** (adjacent-field collaborator) — DEFAULT | 4 | non-trivial terms per section; field-standard terms (RNA-seq, PCA) may rely on the audience | wet-lab partner for a stats-heavy report; PI reading a methods-heavy report |
| **C** (in-field PI / close collaborator) | 6 | only coined / overloaded terms; standard terms need no per-section regloss | direct co-authors, the analyst's PI, immediate lab group |

Rules that hold at every tier:

- **No acronyms in section titles, the abstract, or figure captions** — these are skim surfaces.
- **Coined or overloaded terms** (anything carrying an `overloaded_warning` in the manifest) get the spelled-out form plus the "this is NOT the standard X" disclaimer on first use, regardless of tier.
- **First-use-per-section** stays the rule for whichever terms the tier requires; sections are independent surfaces and a reader landing on §3 should not have to walk back to §2.1.

The per-page budget is a flag for human review, not a hard constraint — it works better as a probe ("does this page feel heavy?") than as a count to enforce mechanically. A methods section that defines `BCLRT` once and uses it 40 times legitimately is fine at any tier.

### Intuitive-before-technical

For load-bearing methodological choices, non-obvious metrics, and surprising results, **lead with the intuitive explanation before the technical statement**. The length is judged by complexity, not by a fixed rule:

| Concept type | Lead-in form |
|---|---|
| Complex analytic method (new framework, multi-step procedure) | Full intuition paragraph before the formal definition |
| Non-obvious metric or transform | Single intuitive sentence before the formula |
| Routine technical detail (standard test, well-known transform) | No lead-in needed |
| Surprising result | Plain-English summary of what the reader should walk away with, before the table or figure |

Example:

> **Without intuitive lead-in (bad).** *We define BCLRT as `dLL = LL_branch - LL_null` for a per-cell logistic regression with two covariates: `log(1 + total panel coverage)` and an artifact-load covariate `u_i`.*
>
> **With intuitive lead-in (good).** *We score each cell by asking: does this cell's pattern of alternative-allele reads look more like the proposed clone-of-origin or like a uniform background? We use a per-cell logistic regression — with controls for coverage and an artifact-load covariate — and report the log-likelihood difference between the branch model and the null. Formally, BCLRT = LL_branch − LL_null (note: this is not the Wilks chi-square statistic; threshold 10 here corresponds to Wilks 20).*

The plain-English lint sub-agent (Phase 4) flags load-bearing concepts that are introduced technical-first. It does not enforce a sentence count.

### Worked examples per analysis type

For every *new aggregation analysis type* introduced in the report, the main body contains one fully-traced concrete example: pick a single SNP / cell / capsule / row, show its raw inputs, the per-row metric calculation, and how it contributes to the aggregate. The example does the explanatory work once — subsequent claims using the same analysis type don't need their own example.

Format preference: small inline figures or sparkline-style mini-tables over big monolithic figures. Tufte sparklines are a strong reference shape. A five-row inline table with raw N, Y, score, rank, contribution is often clearer than a full plot.

Example pattern:

```latex
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Worked example: how a single SNP's per-clone score contributes
    to its aggregate rank. Cell \texttt{c\_017} is shown; the full ranking
    aggregates over all 1{,}231 SNPs.}
    \label{tab:worked_example_snp_score}
    \begin{tabular}{lrrrrr}
        \toprule
        Clone & N & Y & VAF & score & rank \\
        \midrule
        c1 & 12 & 6 & 0.50 & 4.81 & 1 \\
        c2 & 9 & 1 & 0.11 & 0.42 & 7 \\
        c3 & 11 & 0 & 0.00 & 0.00 & 9 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

**Failure modes** (cases where the analysis breaks) get worked examples too, but those live in the supplement / appendix. The main text shows one healthy example per analysis type; the supplement shows the contrasting failure case.

The Phase-3 worked-example gate also catches the inverse failure (single-example-as-proof): "confirmed" / "verified" / "established" claims that rest on one example without hedging. Both failures share a root cause — sloppy handling of the relationship between concrete instances and general claims — so the same phase checks for both.

### Denominator discipline

Every count or rate in the prose has its denominator within one sentence.

- *Bad.* "Consensus floor of 5."
- *Better.* "Consensus floor of 5 (out of 25 operating-point sweep conditions)."

For cross-universe comparisons, also report the universe-eligible-restricted denominator:

- *Bad.* "baseline_band sticky=1, current_iter sticky=3."
- *Better.* "baseline_band sticky=1 of 1 eligible (X21 and X19 are structurally excluded from baseline_band); current_iter sticky=3 of 3 eligible."

Bare percentages are stated alongside the count (or vice versa) so the reader does not have to back out the denominator from rounding.

### Overloaded-name guard

Any coined term that overlaps an established statistics / genomics / ML term needs an explicit "this is NOT the standard X" disclaimer at first use, naming the specific way it differs.

Common overloads:

- **"Log-likelihood ratio test"** when the statistic is `dLL = LL_branch - LL_null` without the factor of 2 (so a threshold of 10 corresponds to Wilks 20, not Wilks 10).
- **"Penalized log-likelihood ratio"** that a reader trained on Wilks chi-square statistics will mis-extrapolate.
- **`cond_p`** for an ordinal score that looks like a per-SNP p-value but is not.
- **"Validation"** when the validation cohort is downstream of the same upstream labeling decisions (so agreement is a self-consistency check, not external validation).

When an overloaded name is used, the manifest's `terms[*].overloaded_warning` field is mandatory.

---

## General Writing Principles

These apply throughout the report:

- **US English.** Default to US spelling and conventions (`analyze`, `normalization`, `behavior`, `signaling`, `center`, `artifact`, `modeling`) unless the planning brief asks otherwise. Do not drift into British forms (`analyse`, `normalisation`, `behaviour`, `signalling`, `centre`, `artefact`, `modelling`) — that drift is a recurring failure mode of this skill, and it is jarring in a US-based lab's reports.
- **Readable over formulaic.** The rigor machinery (manifest sourcing, finding-form titles, acronym budgets, denominators) governs *correctness*; it does not require a flat, methods-section register everywhere. The Abstract, Problem Statement, and the opening of each Results unit should read like a paper a thoughtful person wrote — narrative, motivated, carrying the reader. Save the dense methods-paper voice for the technical detail and the supplement. If a section reads like an archive of verified facts rather than an explanation, it is too formulaic; rewrite the framing without weakening the rigor.
- **Past tense** for methods and results ("We computed...", "The analysis showed..."). Present tense for statements that are currently true ("Figure 3 shows...", "These results suggest...").
- **Active voice** when possible ("We filtered cells with fewer than 500 genes" not "Cells with fewer than 500 genes were filtered").
- **Precision over hedging**: "23% of genes were upregulated" not "a significant proportion of genes were upregulated." Use numbers.
- **One idea per paragraph**. If a paragraph covers two topics, split it.
- **Define before use**. Every abbreviation, every technical term, every symbol — define it before or at first use.
- **Concrete over abstract**. "Expression of TP53 increased 3.2-fold" not "There was a notable change in expression levels."
- **Figures do the heavy lifting**. The text should guide the reader through the figures, not duplicate them. "As shown in Figure 2, treatment increased IL6 expression 4.1-fold..." not "Treatment increased IL6 expression 4.1-fold (Figure 2 shows a bar plot of expression levels...)."

### Read it aloud

The fastest test for stiff prose is to read a sentence aloud. If it sounds like something you would never say to a colleague, rewrite it. Three patterns recur in this skill's output — the fix is shown, not lectured:

- **Stored value, not spoken value.**
  - *Before:* "consensus is positive for a fraction 0.978 of evidenced claims."
  - *After:* "consensus is positive for 97.8% of evidenced claims."
  - The fix is the `unit:"percent"` manifest field (Phase 1): it renders the canonical fraction `0.978` as `97.8\%`, so you write the readable form while the stored `value` stays the verification anchor. Reach for it whenever a fraction-of-a-whole would be spoken as a percentage.

- **Jargon in a skim surface.** A subsection title or the first sentence of a result is read out of context; a bare coined term there reads as noise.
  - *Before:* "Centrality is not a volume proxy."
  - *After:* "Centrality is not just a popularity measure."
  - If the precise term is genuinely load-bearing, gloss it in the same breath rather than dropping it cold.

- **Archive register vs. explanation.** Enumerating verified facts is not the same as explaining them.
  - *Before:* "The consensus score is positive for 97.8% of evidenced claims; the median is 0.75; the negative fraction is 1.1%."
  - *After:* "Among claims that carry any evidence at all, the literature is overwhelmingly consensual — 97.8% lean positive, the median agreement is 0.75, and only 1.1% lean negative."
  - Same numbers, but the second version tells the reader what they *mean* before listing them.

This complements "Readable over formulaic" above: that principle says *why*; these pairs show *how*.
